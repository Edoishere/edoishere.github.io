About Me
======
Hi, I am a master's student in "Stochastics and Data Science" at the University of Turin. I study Probability, Statistics and Machine Learning in particular, I really enjoy studying Reinforcement Learning. \\
In my free time, I love play chess, Valorant and Travel. My ideal holiday is to make a journey and in the past I made many such as: "The Road to Santiago", in Portugal and Spain, and "La via degli Dei" in italy.
