About Me
======
Hi, I am a master's student in "Stochastics and Data Science" at the University of Turin. I study Probability, Statistics and Machine Learning, in particular, I really enjoy studying Reinforcement Learning. 

My ideal holiday is to make a journey with my backpack and my friends. In the past we made many of them, like: "The Road to Santiago", in Portugal and Spain, and "La via degli Dei" in Italy. 

Next year maybe **Sweden!!**

If you want to talk about Reinforcement Learning or playing chess don't esitate to contact me.
